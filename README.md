# User Information Updater

This Go program is designed to interactively update user information, specifically the user's full name and age. The updated information is then saved to a file.

## How it works
The program defines a User struct with fields for the user's full name and age. It also defines methods on the User struct to update these fields.

The main function creates a new User struct.

How to run
To run this program, you need to have Go installed on your machine. You can then run the program with the go run command:

`go run main.go`

This will start the program, which will prompt you to enter your age and full name. After you've entered your information, the program will save it to a file.
